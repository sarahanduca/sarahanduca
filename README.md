## Hi there 🖖

Well, I kind of make some code once in a while, JavaScript mostly because, you know, love is ✨blind✨ <br>
- 🎓 Studying Computer Science at State University of Maringá (UEM)
- 🌿 Currently working on 100 days of code, improving my Vue.js, React.js and TypeScript skills <br>
- 🍄 Also finishing my Uni Project on the recognition of exons and introns on fungi RNA, using Python <br>
- 🤖 Chances I'm doing another Discord Bot <br>
